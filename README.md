Bodybuilding.com coding-challenge
================

Thank you for taking the Bodybuilding.com Coding Challenge. We want to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your
 abilities. We will plan on using your deliverables as a point of conversation during a possible technical interview.
 Our hope is that this takes a few hours, not days. Have fun!

Using Java or Kotlin, create a REST API that returns website navigation data. The full navigation tree is included in [navigation.json](navigation.json).

Requirements:

* The API should load and parse navigation.json into memory once at application startup. It should **not** be reparsed for every request.
* Create a single API endpoint that takes a ID path parameter (/{ID}), here are some examples:
    1. /30day
    2. /30daymain
    3. /Training
* If the ID parameter is missing assume it is "root"
* Using the ID the API will find the node and return JSON for a tree that has been pruned using the following rules:

    1. The root and it's children should *always* be included
    2. The path from the selected ID (node) to the root should be included
    3. The children of other nodes should *not* be included
* If the node cannot be found the endpoint should return 404

#### Pruning Examples

Given this initial tree:


![Initial Tree](start_tree.jpg)


The result when querying the red node should be:


![Result Tree](result_tree.jpg)

Similarly for this node:

![Initial Tree](start_tree2.jpg)

Resulting in:

![Initial Tree](result_tree2.jpg)


#### Submission
* Please create a branch for your work, when ready issue a pull request.
* Make sure you update this  *README* to explains how to start your API. Feel free to mention any important decisions
about the project architecture / layout that you think we should know.
* Include working unit tests
* Please note, when the interview process has concluded you will be removed from the github team, which will also delete your fork of our private repo.
* Please send an email to the recruiter and/or hiring manager you have been working with to notify them you have completed the challenge.


##To use
*   Maven and Java must be installed on computer
    -   Maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
    -   Java: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
*   Easy install, adding both to PATH in environment variables.
*   Go to folder api-code-challenge-clarence-jenkins on the command line and run "mvn spring-boot:run"
*   Open webrowser and go to "localhost:8080/?id= " and add an id of your choice
*   Ctrl + c to stop shut down the springboot executor

##DISCLAIMER 
*   Trying to figure out the 404. If you put anything that is not a valid "id" it always shows the root and its child elements.
